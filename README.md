# JavaScript_Simon_Game
Let's travel back to our old classic game called Simon, where a player has to follow a specific sequence/pattern to cross the levels.

This a simple pattern following game which generates a new sequence on every level and a player has to follow that sequence.
If player fails to do so, the game is restarted.

#Technical:
The game is built in Javascript and jQuery to manipulate the DOM tree. This project evaluates a basic understanding of the JavaScript,
jQuery and related concepts like functions, timer function, DOM manipulation, audio function and much more. 

If you wish to play the game, just download the files and run them and you're good to go.
